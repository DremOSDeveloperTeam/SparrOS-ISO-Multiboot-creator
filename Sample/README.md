# How the sample works

1. Create a folder on your desktop
2. Extract everything from the archives with 7-Zip in to the folder you made
3. Extract Output.7z
4. Delete the ISOLinux.bin in boot/isolinux
5. Find a new Isolinux.bin to replace the old one
6. Use mkisofs or genisoimage to create the image
7. Enjoy :)
